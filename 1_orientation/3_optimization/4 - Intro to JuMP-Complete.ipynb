    "# What is JuMP?\n",
    "\n",
    "JuMP is a _modeling language_ for optimization problems, writen in Julia. \n",
    "\n",
    "When solving an optimization problem, you should use a _solver_ :  a software implementation of an optimization algorithm. Solvers typically need the problem to be written in a very specific format, which can be time-consuming and confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A modeling language (like JuMP) lets you code an optimization problem in a more natural way. It does the translation to the low-level solver format for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of modeling languages out there. Why JuMP?\n",
    "\n",
    "* User-friendly\n",
    "* Matches performance of competitors\n",
    "* Solver-independent\n",
    "* Easy to extend and take advantage of advanced features\n",
